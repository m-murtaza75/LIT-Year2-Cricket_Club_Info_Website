        <H2 style='color:whitesmoke;'>ABOUT US</H2>
        <H2 style='color:whitesmoke;'> The Richard Beamish Cricket Grounds</H2>
        <p>Cork County Cricket Club is Munster’s largest and most successful cricket club located on the Mardyke on the banks of the River Lee in the heart of Cork City. The club was founded in 1874 but cricket has been played here as far back as 1850. We cater for all age groups and abilities from the U-11 Youths through to Senior level.</p>
        <p>Cork County competes in both the Munster and Leinster league and cup competitions and has produced a number of former internationals at both under-age and senior levels. The Mardyke has always been and continues to be the hub of cricket in Munster and is only a short walk from the main gates of University College Cork and Cork City centre.</p>
