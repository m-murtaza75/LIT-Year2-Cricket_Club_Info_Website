        <h2 style="color:oldlace; text-decoration: underline;">&nbspThe Mardyke to host the Oman Cricket Association T20 training camp</h2>
        <img src="news_events/Oman-flag.png" style="width: 270px; height: 130px;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Cork County Cricket Club and Munster Cricket are delighted to announce that Oman Cricket Association, one of the ICC Associate countries participating in the upcoming T20 World Cup Qualifiers, will base themselves at the Mardyke in Cork for their pre-tournament training camp. As the tournament is being hosted by Ireland and Scotland, The Oman Cricket squad and management wish to acclimatise to local conditions by training and playing practice matches during their period in Cork.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Oman Cricket Squad will arrive in Cork on the 15th June and will use the Cork County ground at the Mardyke as their training base from then until the end of June. Accommodation for their stay is kindly provided by our main Club sponsors The River Lee Hotel and during this period, they will play the following T20 challenge games at the Mardyke:</p>        
 
        <p>•v Munster (Wednesday, 17th June)</p>
        <p>•v Cork County (Thursday, 18th June)</p>
        <p>•v Munster (Monday, 22nd June)</p>
        <p>•v Cork County (Thursday, 25th June)</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">All of these games will start at 2pm and will be played in coloured clothing under the ICC T20 World Cup competition regulations. Entry will be free of charge for each match with food and refreshments available in the Clubhouse.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">After the highs of winning Division Two in 2016, Cork County came back down to earth enduring a tough campaign in the top flight which saw them relegated.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">However there are grounds for optimism as they have some talented young cricketers who will join the regulars and three new faces who it’s hoped will compensate for the loss of Stephan Grobler and Gary King who were two big players for the Munstermen.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Diarmuid Carey and Aaron Cawley are two of the brightest talents at the club, and club spokesperson Rob Duggan has high hopes for both.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">“Diarmuid had a real breakthrough season with the ball in 2017 in what was his first full season with the 1st XI and held his own against Leinster Division 1 opposition. His performances by the slow left armer against some of the best batsmen in Leinster certainly caught the eye of the Irish selectors and earned him a well earned call up to the Irish U17 winter training squad. He certainly has the right attitude and desire to continue his improvement and to build on his form with the ball last season and add some important runs with the bat.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"></p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">“Aaron Cawley is coming off the back of an exciting winter with the Irish U19 squad as they took part in the World Cup in NZ and did everyone proud with some fantastic performances in the competition. Aaron proved to be a key member in the Irish seam attack which now sees him training with the Irish Wolfhounds squad. Unfortunately, due to representative commitments and injury Aaron missed much of our season in Division 1 which proved to be a big void to fill but hopefully he’ll be back leading our attack in 2018 and providing some crucial runs in our middle order.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The club’s pre-season preparations, like most clubs, have been hampered badly by the weather.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">“With no suitable indoor practice facilities in the Munster region our pre-season has been badly affected by the extremely poor weather during the late winter/early spring period which has seen groundwork behind where groundsman Matt Reed would like it.”</p>
        
        <h2 style="color:oldlace; text-decoration: underline;">&nbspBig Cork contingent to attend Ireland’s first Test match</h2>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Ireland’s first men’s Test match will be on home soil against Pakistan from Friday, May 11th to Tuesday, May 15th. It will be a historic moment following on from when Ireland and Afghanistan were given Test status in June 2017 to become the 11th and 12th Full Members of the ICC.</p>
